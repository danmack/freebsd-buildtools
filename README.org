* FreeBSD Build Script

A perl script prototype to build and collect detailed timing
statistics on the FreeBSD build process.

Currently this uses a child process to scrape the log file repeatedely
which is a terrible idea.  I will instead have the child process do
something more intelligent in the next release.
