* FreeBSD Build Script

A perl script prototype to build and collect detailed timing
statistics on the FreeBSD build process.

Currently this uses a child process to scrape the log file repeatedely
which is a terrible idea.  I will instead have the child process do
something more intelligent in the next release.

Currently it outputs a log in the format below with two columns of
timings - time since last section and time since build started.

Because the stages can change from release to release, there is an
included configuration file that should be pretty self explanatory to
use. This will allow the program to handle differnt match patterns
based on the SVN version - if needed.
